# 0x06-regular_expressions

This directory includes the implementation of regular experessions (regex) in software engineering. Regular expressions are very powerful in
that they can match patterns and can manipuklate texts in various programming languages. 

## Introduction

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are patterns used for matching character combinations in strings. They are widely used in programming for tasks like text searching, data validation, and text manipulation. This repository aims to provide examples and explanations to help you understand and work with regular expressions effectively.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/examples`: Contains code examples demonstrating various regular expression patterns and their usage in different programming languages.
- `/explanations`: Contains detailed explanations and documentation about regex syntax, features, and best practices.
- `README.md`: The main README file you're currently reading.
