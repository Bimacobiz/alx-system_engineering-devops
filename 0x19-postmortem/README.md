Postmortem: When the Web Stack Took a Coffee Break ‚òïÔ∏è

Issue Summary:

Duration:

Start Time: January 22, 2024, 03:45 PM UTC
End Time: January 22, 2024, 07:30 PM UTC
Impact:

Our web app decided to pull a Houdini act, disappearing for 20% of users and giving the rest a leisurely stroll through the digital equivalent of molasses.
Customer support got a workout, and our servers started sending us "I need a vacation" postcards.
Root Cause:

Forget about ghost stories; this was a load balancer setting misadventure. Some servers were throwing a party, while others were left twiddling their digital thumbs.
Timeline:

Detection:

03:45 PM UTC: Our monitoring system, the unsung hero, raised its hand and said, "Houston, we have a problem."
Investigation:

03:50 PM UTC: Checked the application servers for rogue code. Found none, except for a few lines moonwalking.
04:15 PM UTC: Poked around the database servers, suspecting a database rebellion. Turned out, they were just quietly sipping on SQL queries.
04:45 PM UTC: Network infrastructure got a suspicious side-eye, and we found the load balancer doing its best impression of a DJ with a broken turntable.
05:15 PM UTC: Load balancer misconfiguration discovered. Cue facepalm.
Escalation:

05:30 PM UTC: Called in the cavalry‚ÄîDevOps and Infrastructure teams rode in on digital horses (code is mightier than a sword, right?).
Resolution:

07:30 PM UTC: Load balancer got a stern talking to, settings were fixed, and servers were reminded that teamwork makes the dream work.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

Load balancer settings were playing favorites, causing a server party on one end and leaving the others feeling like the unpopular kid at a school dance.
Resolution:

Load balancer settings were wrangled into shape, ensuring fair distribution of workload.
Implemented more monitoring checks because, let's be honest, we all need a watchful eye.
Fun Zone:


Caption: When your web stack decides to take a coffee break without asking for permission.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Task 1: Schedule a load balancer therapy session‚Äîeveryone deserves to feel valued.
Task 2: Spice up monitoring with disco lights and fog machines. Okay, maybe not, but definitely add more load balancing metrics.
Task 3: Introduce automated load balancing configuration testing in the CI/CD pipeline‚Äîbecause we don't trust those mischievous settings.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Task 4: Post-incident review meeting‚Äîbring snacks, because retrospectives are better with chips.
Task 5: Share lessons learned, update the playbook, and maybe create a "Load Balancer's Guide to Fair Play."
This postmortem isn't just a tale of servers and settings; it's a reminder that even the most well-behaved technology can have a rebellious streak. Keep calm, carry on, and make sure your load balancer isn't moonlighting as a party planner. Cheers to a web stack that knows when to take a coffee break and when to get back to work! ‚òïÔ∏èüöÄ
