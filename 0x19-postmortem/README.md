Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident

Issue Summary:

Duration:

Start Time: January 22, 2024, 03:45 PM UTC
End Time: January 22, 2024, 07:30 PM UTC
Impact:

The outage affected our main web application, rendering it completely inaccessible for approximately 20% of our users.
Users experienced slow response times for another 40% of the user base.
This resulted in a significant drop in user engagement and a spike in customer support complaints.
Root Cause:

The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an uneven distribution of traffic and overloading specific servers.
Timeline:

Detection:

Detected at 03:45 PM UTC by an automated monitoring alert indicating a sudden spike in error rates and server response times.
Investigation:

03:50 PM UTC: Initial investigation focused on the application servers, suspecting a possible issue with the application code.
04:15 PM UTC: As no anomalies were found in the application code, attention shifted to the database servers, exploring potential database connection or query performance issues.
04:45 PM UTC: Database analysis revealed normal behavior, prompting a review of the network infrastructure.
05:15 PM UTC: Identified a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings causing uneven distribution of traffic.
Escalation:

05:30 PM UTC: Incident escalated to the DevOps and Infrastructure teams for further analysis and resolution.
Resolution:

07:30 PM UTC: Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute traffic among application servers, restoring normal functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:

The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to uneven distribution of traffic, causing specific servers to become overloaded while others were underutilized.
Resolution:

Load balancer settings were adjusted to ensure equal distribution of incoming traffic among all available servers.
Additional monitoring checks were implemented to promptly detect and alert on any future load balancing discrepancies.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Conduct a thorough review of load balancing configurations across all services to identify and rectify any potential misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring alerts to provide more granular insights into load balancer performance and distribution.
Implement automated testing for load balancing configurations as part of the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Task 1: Review and document load balancing configurations for all services.
Task 2: Enhance monitoring system to include specific load balancing metrics.
Task 3: Implement automated load balancing configuration testing in the CI/CD pipeline.
Task 4: Conduct a post-incident review meeting to share lessons learned and identify areas for further improvement.
This postmortem serves as a guide for future incident responses and highlights the importance of comprehensive monitoring and systematic troubleshooting to minimize downtime and enhance the overall reliability of our web stack.
